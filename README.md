# grade_calculator

In this project, we will see the python code of a grade calculation for final adjusted student grades.

To execute the program, a python 3.x editor and a text file of a list of grade result for each student are required.
In the list each student should have 3 different grades so that take the weighted average of the final grade for all of them.

Onece we run the code a new text file as "final_adjusted_grades" will be created at the same file where you keep the file and 
the gradebook. final_adjusted_grades.txt is the list of the grades.
